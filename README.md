This mod reworks the camping system.

The changes are as follows:

-You are no longer restricted to invite only one visitor via amiibo to the campsite per day. This limit is removed and each newly invited camper just sends the old one home.
-Amiibo campers don't want you to craft something for them anymore. They also don't need to be invited on 3 days.
-Normal and amiibo campers now let you decide who should leave the island when it's already full and don't suggest someone randomly.
